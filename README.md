# Cells3D
## Version 1.0.0 - Stable

This is the first version of a phase-field model that simulate a tumoral colony and a membrane.

In this version we have implemented the superficial tension and adhesive interaction between the cells and an algorithm to accelerate the numerical integration of a system with several order parameters.

### Next features:
 - Biological Membrane;
 - Elasticity;
 - Traction forces.
